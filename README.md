# PhD Computation Files

## :dart: About
This repository contains all computaion files which were used within my Ph.D. thesis. Additionally, one will find the graphical representation of the calculation.

## :recycle: Workflow
Each structure was first modeled using [Avogadro 1.2.0](https://avogadro.cc/)<sup>[1]</sup> and afterwards a geometry optimization was performed using [GFN2-xTB](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html)<sup>[2]</sup>. In order to calculate the free single point energy and its correction term [ORCA 5.0](https://www.orcasoftware.de/tutorials_orca/) was used with the following level of theory:
 - OPT: *TPSS-D3BJ/def2-TZVP*
 - FSPE: *PW6B95-D3BJ/def2-QZVP*
